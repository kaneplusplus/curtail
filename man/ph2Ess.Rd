\title{Expected curtailed sample size}
\usage{
ph2Ess(p, n, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{vector containing the probability of successful outcomes
in Stage 1 (p1) and Stage 2 (p2)}

\item{n}{vector containing sample sizes planned for Stage 1 (n1) 
and Stage 2 (n2)}

\item{r}{vector containing the minimum number of Stage 1 successes 
to continue to Stage 2 (r1) and the minimum number of Stage 2 
successes to reject the null hypothesis (r2)}
}
\description{
The expected number of patients who are enrolled and followed to their
endpoint before critical endpoints in Stage 1 and Stage 2 are achieved
}
