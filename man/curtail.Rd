\title{Design of One- and Two-Stage Clinical Trials with Curtailed Sampling}
\description{
The \pkg{curtail} package is used for the planning of one- and two-
stage clinical trials with curtailed sampling.  Under curtailed sampling, an early 
decision in the trial is allowed as soon as any predefined statistical endpoint is 
reached.  The package provides functions to help select a design, including 
visualizations to compare criteria for different choices of parameters, and functions 
to calculate power, significance, and expected sample size, among others.

In the one-stage design, patients are assumed to be enrolled into the trial 
sequentially up to a maximum number of patients.  A critical value of observed 
patient successes needed to deem the therapy superior is set prior to the start of
the study.  The \code{power_significance_plot} and \code{power_significance_ROC} 
functions provide visualizations to compare power and significance levels for 
various choices of critical values.  Also, the \code{critical_values} function 
will calculate the critical value to maintain a desired significance level.  
Under curtailed sampling, the study ends as soon as enough the observed patient 
successes meets the critical value or as soon as too many patient failures have 
been observed.  The smallest number of patient enrollees needed to reach a 
decision under curtailed sampling is described by the Stopped Negative Binomial 
distribution.  This package also provides density and other related functions for 
the Stopped Negative Binomial Distribution.  

The two-stage design presented in this package is a modification of Simon's two-
stage design with separate, but nested, criteria for early stopping in Stage 1 
and efficacy in Stage 2.  The two-stage design has two critical values which can 
both be determined with the \code{critical_values} function to maintain a desired 
significance level and probability of early stopping.  These critical values are set 
prior to the start of the study to determine the number of patient successes in 
the first stage needed to continue the trial to the second stage and the critical 
number of efficacy successes throughout the trial needed to deem the therapy 
superior.  Under curtailed sampling, early decisions can be made in Stage 1 and 
Stage 2.  The \code{best_designs} function finds the optimal and minimax design 
for a fixed total sample size.  Other functions are provided to calculate the 
expected sample size, power, significance, and probability of early stopping in 
the trial given a choice of design parameters.
